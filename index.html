Bellini is a girl who loves to play with her doggie foster siblings, and we'd love to find a forever home with a doggie brother. She'd also love to go to an active home or a home with children to play with. She enjoys chewing on her antlers and nylabones, chasing balls and squeakie toys, and cuddling with her humans. As with all young puppies, she'll require lots of continued training and socialization to ensure she grows into a happy and well balanced adult dog.</p>

His ears are scarred and mangled from fly bites, his eyes were both infected when he came to us, and his spirit was clearly broken.Bubba is now is a loving Paw Placement foster home, and he's blossoming before our eyes. As soon as he had a bath - possibly his first ever - we could tell he felt better. He rubbed himself on a towel, flipped on his back and rolled on the carpet, and got the "so fresh and so clean" zoomies! Next was teaching him to walk on a leash, then house training and potty training, socializing him with people and exposing him to a whole new world.</p>

					<p class="card-text">Calhoun and two other puppies were found in the desert, over 10 miles from the nearest home. Calhoun was welcomed into a loving foster home that is experienced with hunting breeds, specifically hounds. Foster momma tells us Cal is all hound - high energy, intelligent and vocal. Cal is extremely loving and affectionate with his people, friendly and outgoing with new people, and social and playful with dogs. Cal is looking for a forever home that is experienced with hunting or working breeds. He would also very much prefer to be placed in a home with a doggie playmate. Calhoun will not be placed in an apartment or condo - this boy needs a yard.</p>
